# Picossa
Very simple discord bot using openAI DALL-E to generate images

## Generate image 
add your openai api key and discord bot token as an env variable :
- OPENAI_TOKEN
- PICOSSA_TOKEN


## Get remaining credits on your account
add your email/password to make it work because openAI doesn't offer an API endpoint to get remaining credits so we have to use a headless browser and selenium to manipulate the data.
- OPENAI_USERNAME
- OPENAI_PASSWORD
